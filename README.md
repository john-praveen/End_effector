# End Effector for Robotic Arm

This project is part of the **Engineering Design Realization** course at the **University of Moratuwa**. The goal is to design and implement a functional end effector that can be integrated with a robotic arm for object manipulation tasks.
The project was carried out in reference to the MCS-1-RP EOAT by WSR (https://mixedpalletizing.com/en/solutions/grippers-and-more/) and the design was a scaled down version of it.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The end effector is designed to:
- Vaccuum grip and place boxes in warehouse/ super market settings
- Be controlled via microcontroller or external driver
- Interface with a robotic manipulator system/ Host

The project includes:
- Mechanical design (CAD)
- Electrical control (e.g., Pneumatic controls,motor drivers, communication with the host)
- Firmware (AVR - ATMEGA 2560)
- Prototyping and testing
